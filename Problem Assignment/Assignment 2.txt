Assignment-2 : Rapidly Expanding Random Tree.
Objective of the assignment is to write a program to find a path from the start
point to the goal point using RRT.
1. Generate a rectangular workspace with three or more obstacles.
2. Mark the start point and the goal point in the workspace.
3. Generate feasible points.
(b) Generate a set of random points from the start point and
connect it to a tree forming branches. From the start point the next
feasible points (one or more) may be made at a random direction with a
fixed step length. Generate the roadmap in the form of a tree with
branches. Find a path from the start point to the goal point.
4. Submit the full program and results showing points 1-3. Results should
show several figures (4-5) that show the work space with obstacles with
start and goal point. Road map generated . Final path from initial point to
goal point.
5. One result should show failed cases , with suitable object position or
shapes.
